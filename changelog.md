### Changes and updates over time.

|Version|Update Note|
|:-----:|:----------|
|May 8th, 2024|Made it stop blocking the AUTTP and gave an actual tutorial. Also separated the changelog from the readme. (All of the MD stuff was recommended by my Dad's friend)|
|May 7th, 2024|Now saves the collected UTTP member name and ID lists to separate text files instead of needing to copy them directly from the terminal window.|
